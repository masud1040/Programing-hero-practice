// You went shopping to buy cakes and donuts with X tk (the currency of Bangladesh).

// First, you bought one cake for A tk at a cake shop.

// Then, with the money you had left, you bought as many donuts as possible for B tk each, at a donut shop.

// How much do you have left after all your shopping?

// Example 1
// Input: totalMoney = 100, cakeCost = 20, donutCost = 10

// Output: 0

// Explanation: Started with 100 tk. Bought cake for 20 tk, 80 tk left. Bought 8 donuts (80 / 10) for 80 tk. 0 tk left.

// Example 2
// Input: totalMoney = 50, cakeCost = 30, donutCost = 7

// Output: 6

// Explanation: Started with 50 tk. Bought cake for 30 tk, 20 tk left. Bought 2 donuts (Math.floor(20 / 7)) for 14 tk. 6 tk left.

// Constraints
// `totalMoney`, `cakeCost`, and `donutCost` are positive integers.
// `donutCost` will always be greater than 0.

  const donuts = Math.floor(remainingMoney / donutCost);
